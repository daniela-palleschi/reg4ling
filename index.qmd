## Style guide

As a self-respecting Canadian, I bounce between what is typically considered 'American' and 'British' spelling. This will be most notable in my use of -ise and -ize, but will never result in a dropped 'u' from words like *colour*, which is used often in plots. I say this so that non-native speakers don't start to think they've been spelling words wrong.
