# Course overview {.unnumbered}

This course fast tracks through different types of regression most relevant to linguistic research. These materials are by no means exhaustive, and should be supplemented by reading textbook length treatments. The majority of my materials lean heavily on @winter_statistics_2019, which I highly recommend. I also took inspiration from @sonderegger_regression_nodate-1, which came out this year and I haven't fully explored yet. So far, it looks like a very thorough textbook that I would also recommend you check out.

Before you begin the course, I would like to paraphrase something Prof. Shravan Vasishth said in the opening remarks for the annual summer school for Statistcal Methods for Linguistics and Psychology back in 2020 which has stuck with me: *get comfortable with partial knowledge*. We are not trained statisticians, and likely never will be (Vasishth himself is a certified statistician, in addition to professor of psycholinguistics). So get comfortable with partial understanding of the math behind these models, and focus on their application and interpretation.

This website is a work-in-progress. Materials will be updated/brushed up throughout the semester.
