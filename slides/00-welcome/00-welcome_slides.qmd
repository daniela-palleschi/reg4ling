# Course description

- via hands-on exercises in RStudio with the R programming language, we will develop skills and know-how related to
  + analysing linguistic data with *linear models*
  + the *theory* behind linear models
  + implement *(generalised) linear (mixed) models*
  + learn how to **communicate** our findings

# Course credits

This course is part of [Modul 9 (Forschungsmodul)](https://gremien.hu-berlin.de/de/amb/2018/57/57_2018_ma_linguistik_2018_druck.pdf) and is worth 4 LP. A break down of the course credits:

```{r}
#| echo: false
dplyr::tribble(
  ~"LP", ~"type", ~"task",
  "1LP","preparation", "readings",
  "1LP","participation", "lecture materials/exercises",

  "1LP", "preparation", "final homework due March 29th"
) |> 
  knitr::kable() |> 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

- Office hours: Wednesdays, 15.00-16.00 (by appointment)

# Reading and preparation

- this course mainly follows @winter_statistics_2019
- by now, you should be familiar with the concepts in Chaters 1-3
  + Intro to R
  + the tidyverse and reproducible workflow
  + Descriptive statistics, models, and distributions
  
## Syllabus



## Further readings

- there are lots of useful resources out there, specifically:
  + Bodo Winter's tutorials on linear (mixed) models [@winter_linear_2013; @winter_very_2014]
  + @sonderegger_regression_nodate-1: a recently published book, I'd say more intermediate than @winter_statistics_2019
  + the [PsyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io/) website is a *great* resource for hands-on stats and/or data analysis in R from the University of Glasgow School of Psychology and Neuroscience
  

# A word on reproducibility {.unlisted .unnumbered visibility="uncounted"}

- I have no expectations in this course for whether you use .R scripts, Rmarkdown, or Quarto (all of which available under `File > New File`)
- If you're using Rmarkdown or Quarto (recommended), I suggest you have the following code at the end of every script:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
sessionInfo()
```

- this will print your session info at the end of each document to print your current packages and R version (etc.)
- In this course you'll see some examples of tools for a reproducible workflow
  + but I won't explicitly discuss them (unless it's requested)
  
# Session Info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
