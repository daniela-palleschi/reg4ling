  abstract = {Experimental designs that sample both subjects and stimuli from a larger population need to account for random effects of both subjects and stimuli using mixed-effects models. However, much of this research is analyzed using analysis of variance on aggregated responses because researchers are not confident specifying and interpreting mixed-effects models. This Tutorial explains how to simulate data with random-effects structure and analyze the data using linear mixed-effects regression (with the lme4 R package), with a focus on interpreting the output in light of the simulated parameters. Data simulation not only can enhance understanding of how these models work, but also enables researchers to perform power calculations for complex designs.

  abstract = {Statistics for Linguists: An Introduction Using R is the first statistics textbook on linear models for linguistics. The book covers simple uses of linear models through generalized models to more advanced approaches, maintaining its focus on conceptual issues and avoiding excessive mathematical details. It contains many applied examples using the R statistical programming environment. Written in an accessible tone and style, this text is the ideal main resource for graduate and advanced undergraduate students of Linguistics statistics courses as well as those in other fields, including Psychology, Cognitive Science, and Data Science.},

  abstract = {This tutorial serves as a quick boot camp to jump-start your own analyses with linear mixed effects models. This text is different from other introductions by being decidedly conceptual; I will focus on why you want to use mixed models and how you should use them. While many introductions to this topic can be very daunting to readers who lake the appropriate statistical background, this text is going to be a softer kind of introduction… so, don't panic! The tutorial requires R – so if you haven't installed it yet, go and get it! I also recommend reading tutorial 1 in this series before you go further. You can find it here:},
