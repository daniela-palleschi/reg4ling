This lecture jumpts to chapter 12 'Genearlised Lienar Models 1: Logistic Regression" [@winter_statistics_2019]. We're skipping a few chapters, which I encourage you to go through on your own. However, they cover topics that you presumably have covered in previous courses (namely significance testing, *t*-values and *p*-values).

## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Today we will learn...


## Set-up environment  {.unnumbered}

```{r}
# suppress scientific notation
options(scipen=999)
```

We'll also need to load in our required packages. Hopefully you've already install the required packages (if not, go to @sec-software).

```{r}
# load libraries
pacman::p_load(
               tidyverse,
               here,
               broom,
               lme4,
               janitor,
               languageR)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

# extra packages for the lecture notes/slides
pacman::p_load(
               patchwork,
               knitr,
               kableExtra)
```

## Binomial distribution

## Generalised linear models

## Logistic regression

## Log-odds, odds ratio, and probabilities


## Summary

-   we saw that the equation for a straight line boils down to its intercept and slope

-   we fit our first linear model with a categorical predictor

### Important terms {.unnumbered .smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: false
tribble(
 ~"term", ~"description/other terms",
 
) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```
